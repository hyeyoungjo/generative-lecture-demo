            "explanation": "A selector matrix has rows that are transposed unit vectors; choosing a subset of those unit vectors crops (selects) entries, while arranging them in a different order permutes entries. Thus the same construction—appropriate choice and ordering of e_i^T rows—implements cropping (selection) or permutation.",

            "question": "Complete the statement: An m × n selector matrix A has rows equal to transposed unit vectors e_i^T, so the matrix product A x is equivalent to forming a length-m vector whose entries are specific ______ of the original vector x.",
            "options": [],
            "correctAnswer": "entries",
            "explanation": "By definition each row of A is e_i^T, and e_i^T x returns the i-th entry of x. Therefore A x collects specific entries of x into a new vector. This emphasizes that selector matrices 'select' or extract components rather than performing general linear combinations.",
