Gauge bosons associated with the electroweak interaction (W and Z) gain mass through electroweak symmetry breaking, while the photon remains massless because it corresponds to an unbroken gauge symmetry; gluons remain massless because the strong interaction's SU(3) symmetry is unbroken.

From the slide concepts about nuclear binding and stability, which statement best explains why the two isotopes can have different stability and decay behavior despite identical Z?",

              "Because the electric charge of the nucleus changes with N, altering electromagnetic repulsion and stability.",

            "explanation": "The slide emphasizes that nuclei are bound states of protons and neutrons via the strong force and are described by Z and N with A = Z+N. Stability depends on the detailed balance between attractive strong interactions among nucleons, the neutron-to-proton ratio, and binding energy per nucleon. Changing N alters that balance and can move an isotope into regions of stability or different decay modes on the nuclear chart. The other options are incorrect because electric charge depends only on Z (not N), the strong force acts among all nucleons (not only protons), and neutrons do contribute to the mass number A.",

            "explanation": "The nuclear chart displays stability and decay types as functions of N and Z. Whether a nucleus will beta-decay, emit neutrons, or be stable depends largely on the neutron-to-proton ratio (N/Z) and how that ratio affects the binding energy and balance of forces in the nucleus.
